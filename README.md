# sourcemod-plugins
A collection of various [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) plugins written for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
Some might work in other games but all plugins are only tested in CS:GO.

They were developed for a custom aim-training server of mine or for community events for the people I play with.
Refer to the beginning of the respective plugin source code for descriptions and ConVar settings.
